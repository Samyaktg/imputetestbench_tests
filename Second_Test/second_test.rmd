## Suggestions:

### 1. DataFrame to TimeSeries Conversion

One common issue encountered was the necessity to convert the dataframe into a timeseries object. Running the dataframe directly resulted in errors. Including an inbuilt function to check and convert the dataframe directly into a timeseries object would be a valuable update.

### 2. Documentation Enhancement

Upon reviewing the code of `imputeTestbench` and exploring related research papers, I identified areas for documentation improvement:
1. The documentation lacks information about MAPE and MAE error metrics, which are available error parameters. Referencing the research paper [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6309171/) can provide users with more clarity.

### 3. Additional Imputation Methods in ImputeTS Package

The `ImputeTS` package offers reliable imputation methods that haven't been covered in the current code:

- `na_kalman`: Missing Value Imputation by Kalman Smoothing

- `na_ma`: Missing Value Imputation by Weighted Moving Average

- `na_random`: Missing Value Imputation by Random Sample

- `na_remove`: Remove Missing Values

- `na_replace`: Replace Missing Values by a Defined Value

- `na_seadec`: Seasonally Decomposed Missing Value Imputation

- `na_seasplit`: Seasonally Splitted Missing Value Imputation



Incorporating these methods is crucial for a comprehensive comparison of imputation results.

### 4. Explore Additional Imputation Methods

Consider exploring other imputation methods mentioned in research papers like [this one](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1510/1510.03924.pdf) to enhance the diversity of available imputation techniques, ensuring they fit within the desired time complexity.

### 5. Multivariate Imputation

For multivariate imputation, consider utilizing various packages such as mice, mtsdi, mvnmle, missForest, VIM, Amelia, and Hmisc. Comparing results from these packages and selecting the optimal ones for the specific use case will enhance the package's versatility.

I hope these suggestions are considered to make the package more robust and reliable for users.
